      "Santorini Is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece. It is a part of the Cyclades islands and sits in the Aegean Sea, halfway between Athens and Crete. The crescent-shaped island is famous for its iconic white houses, blue dome churches and windmills. It is the most photographed island in the world. The highlights of Santorini are its hikes, beaches, sunset views, hot springs and clifftop wineries.The best things to do in Santorini are hiking the caldera, wine tours, luxury sunset cruises of the caldera, swimming in the hot springs, and visiting the charming villages of Pyrgos and Emporio. The beaches of Santorini are made up of volcanic rocks and pebbles, unlike the white sandy beaches of other islands in Greece. However, the red and black sand beaches are still picturesque and peaceful. Santorini is one of the most sought-after places for a romantic honeymoon in Greece, and rightly so.The moon shape of Santorini is because of the severe volcanic eruption in 1650 BC that formed the island. This eruption created a caldera (a large volcanic crater). While most of the caldera is filled with water today, a small semicircle part of it is left above the ground and is one of the most stunning parts of the island. Nea and Palea Kameni are the active volcanos still found in Santorini.",

    brief:
      "Kolkata, India's second biggest city, is a perpetually ongoing festival of human existence, concurrently luxurious and squalid, refined and frantic, pointedly futuristic, while beautifully in decay. A vibrant 350-year-old metropolis located on India's Eastern Coast, the capital of West Bengal thrives on contradictions and imposing spectacles; nothing is commonplace in this city. Famously known as the City of Joy, Kolkata is, in every sense, the artistic, cultural and intellectual capital of the country. Kolkata's streets are vivid, hectic, chaotic, and yet, brimming with life and creativity. Driven by the indomitable spirit of the self-made middle class, the city has created a beautiful juxtaposition of the old colonial-era charm with the nascent upcoming hipster culture that thrives amongst the city's millennial residents.Starting from admiring the flourishing art scene in the city to going on rewarding gastronomical explorations to wandering amidst the countless bazaars to sitting by the banks of the Hooghly and enjoying a peaceful sunset, Kolkata is soaked in layers and layers of heritage and culture, and peeling off each layer to look beneath the hood is a very rewarding, once-in-a-lifetime experience. As the famous quote goes, If you want a city with a soul, come to Calcutta.Formerly the capital of the British empire before the government was shifted to Delhi, Kolkata has a distinct tinge of its royal past lingering in every nook and cranny of the city. If you want to soak in some of the city's regal past, take a walk along the streets of North Kolkata, which houses some of the oldest mansions in the city, swathed with vines and a persistent sense of aristocratic pride. Kolkata is home to Rabindranath Tagore's ancestral house, which has now been converted into a museum and houses a staggering collection of family portraits and paintings. There are plenty of ghats all over the city where you can sit and enjoy a sunset while sipping on tea, one of the most noted of these being the Prinsep Ghat, which offers stunning views of the Vidyasagar Setu in the backdrop. Close by is Millennium Park, which is a beautified waterfront park from where you can avail boat rides and cruises.Kolkata has a very lively nightlife, and the entire stretch along Park Street houses innumerable bars and pubs where you can party the night away. Kolkata's street food is famous all across the country, and the city is lined with eateries and food stalls at every corner, where you can savour local Bengali food, or try out local snacks such as Jhalmuri, or Ghugni Chaat.",
